<i>I’ve just noticed, why are there missing numbers on their rooms?</i>
*Dorm Manager: Oh right, I’ve only seen it now, actually. There’s no 4 and 6 in 204 and 206.*
<i>Who stays at 204 and 206?</i>
*Dorm Manager: The missing girl is from 206.*
<i>That’s interesting. Let’s go to her room.</i>
*Dorm Manager: We checked her room for possible clues. Their room looks the same, except for unusual marks on the rims of her bed.*
*dorm manager shows the investigator the room*
*Sees the repetition of the number “205” on the sides.*
<i>Hmm, there are possibly more clues in room 205.</i>
$Go to room 205.
